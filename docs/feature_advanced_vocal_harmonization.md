# Feature: Advanced Vocal Harmonization

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the Advanced Vocal Harmonization feature, which allows users to generate harmonies based on input vocal tracks.

## Implementation Details
- **Input Handling**: The system now checks for empty or null input vocal tracks to prevent runtime errors.
- **Harmony Generation Logic**: The logic has been updated to handle various audio file types and ensure that the generated harmonies are contextually appropriate.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system should analyze the input vocal track and suggest harmonies.
- The generated harmonies should be contextually appropriate based on the input.
- Users should be able to adjust the generated harmonies in real-time.

## Testing
- Unit tests have been added to verify the functionality of the harmony generation logic under various input conditions.

## Conclusion
The feature has been successfully implemented and meets the acceptance criteria outlined in the project documentation.
