# Issues to Address

1. Review the generated code for logical flow.
   - Consider adding more descriptive comments in the code for clarity.
   - Ensure that the harmony generation logic can handle various input formats (e.g., different audio file types).
2. Check for edge cases that may not have been handled.
   - Implement handling for empty or null input vocal tracks to prevent runtime errors.
   - Ensure that the harmony generation logic can handle various input formats (e.g., different audio file types).
   - Add checks for extreme values for harmony levels (e.g., values below 0 or above 1).
3. Ensure functional integrity across all components.
   - Add tests to verify harmony generation logic under various input conditions.
   - Verify that the UI updates correctly when the harmony generation process is initiated.
4. **Logical Flow**: 
   - Ensure that the flow of data through the harmony generation process is clear and well-structured.
5. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Check for potential issues with extreme values for harmony levels (e.g., values below 0 or above 1).
6. **Functional Integrity**: 
   - Verify that all components interact correctly and that there are no unexpected behaviors during the harmony generation process.

## Milestone
- Milestone: Version 1.0 Release

## Epic
- Epic: Vocal Processing Enhancements

## Feature
- Feature: Advanced Vocal Harmonization

## User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to generate harmonies based on the input vocal track so that I can enhance my music production.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system should analyze the input vocal track and suggest harmonies.
- The generated harmonies should be contextually appropriate based on the input.
- Users should be able to adjust the generated harmonies in real-time.

## Status
- Task in progress.
