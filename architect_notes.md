# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks

1. Review the generated code for logical flow.
2. Check for edge cases that may not have been handled.
3. Ensure functional integrity across all components.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions

1. **Redundant Test Cases**: The `HarmonyGeneratorTest.cpp` and `harmony_generator_tests.cpp` files contain similar test cases for handling empty input vocal tracks and valid input vocal tracks. These can be consolidated into a single test file to avoid duplication.

2. **Repeated Code in UI Components**: The `MainComponent.cpp` and `HarmonyGenerator.cpp` files both have similar logic for handling UI updates and state management. This logic could be refactored into a shared utility function to reduce redundancy.

3. **Similar Documentation**: The `README.md` and `design_functional_vision.md` files both describe the features of the VocalArchitect. Some sections overlap and could be merged or referenced to streamline documentation.

## Bugs and Functional Issues

1. **Bug in Harmony Generation**: Occasionally, the harmony generation process fails to produce output when the input vocal track is at the maximum harmony level.
2. **UI Update Delay**: There is a noticeable delay in UI updates after the harmony generation process is initiated, which may confuse users.

## File and Directory Structure Adjustments

- Adjusted the directory structure to align with the requirements specified in 'README.md'.
- Ensured that all source files are organized under the 'Source' directory, with appropriate subdirectories for 'Core' and 'GUI'.
- Verified that test files are located in the 'Tests' directory under the appropriate subdirectory.

## Gaps to Feature Completeness

1. **User Feedback Mechanism**: There is currently no mechanism to provide users with feedback on the status of the harmony generation process. Implementing a progress indicator or status messages would enhance user experience.

2. **Advanced Harmony Customization**: Users should have the ability to customize the generated harmonies further, such as adjusting the intervals or selecting specific harmony types. This feature is not yet implemented.

3. **Error Handling for Unsupported Formats**: While there is basic error handling for unsupported audio file types, more comprehensive error messages and user guidance are needed to improve usability.

4. **Performance Optimization**: The harmony generation process may require optimization for real-time performance, especially when handling larger audio files or multiple tracks simultaneously.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Additional unit tests are needed to cover edge cases and ensure that all components function correctly under various conditions, particularly for the new features being added.
